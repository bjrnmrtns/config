1. Download iso e.g. latest Ubuntu
2. Insert usb stick
3. Run: diskutil list
4. Look for the correct drive of the USB stick, e.g. /dev/disk3 (be carefull, you don't want to overwrite the MacOS partition)
5. Use dd (like on linux) for creating the USB stick.
6. Run: sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/disk3 bs=4M
7. Make sure the other system will boot from the USB stick.
8. Insert USB stick.
9. Boot system.
