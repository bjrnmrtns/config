# Making a bootable usb-stick from MacOS
1. Download iso e.g. latest Ubuntu
2. Insert usb stick
3. Run: diskutil list
4. Look for the correct drive of the USB stick, e.g. /dev/disk3 (be carefull, you don't want to overwrite the MacOS partition)
5. If the disk is mounted, unmount it with diskutility. You do not want to eject it.
6. Use dd (like on linux) for creating the USB stick.
7. Run: sudo dd if=ubuntu.iso of=/dev/disk3 bs=4M
8. Make sure the other system will boot from the USB stick.
9. Insert USB stick.
10. Boot system.
11. Start installation. When partitioning make sure you create a UEFI partition.
