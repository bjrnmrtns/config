# Todo
+ partition.sh script which is downloadable during NixOS configuration using curl
+ make partition.sh interactive so it can ask for disk to partition
- add  minimal configuration.nix and hardware-configuration.nix ( ssh access / git private repo access -> both without passwords)
- for the above step we need a way to get public keys from other machines
- side-note not really todo -> every machine has its own private / public key pair, vaultwarden should only contain passphrases, but not if no two machines have access to another machine then private keys should be part of vaultwarden
